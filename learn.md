[Ken Birmans Course](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/CS5412/2014sp/Syllabus.htm)

How cloud client systems work. music or video players, Shazzam

Network routing : BGP, high availability routers, future secure networks. Routing has a key role to play in the cloud. 

P2P file sharing and search : This latter functionality is often called a “key,value” store and is frequently implemented using a “distributed hash table”. We’ll study CAN and Chord, two widely known examples of DHTs.

First and second tier cloud services : Best-known examples include Memcached and Dynamo. We’ll also look briefly at GFS, BigTable, Chubby, Zookeeper, Sinfonia, MapReduce and other services and will see where each lives. 

Adaptive Overlays for the tier 2 cloud : Beehive, Pastry (a Plaxton-tree DHT structure that creates flexibility as to which nodes a given node should peer with) and Kelips (a gossip-based DHT with O(1) lookup times).

Torrents and Tit-for-Tat Incentives. BAR Gossip 

Anatomy of a cloud. CAP theorem 

"BASE methodology versus ACID model : 

Consistency and time. Logical and Vector clocks. Consistent cuts. 

2 and 3-phase commit 

Consensus and the FLP theorem : FLP asserts that fault-tolerant consensus is “impossible” in asynchronous systems. What do these terms mean? How is FLP proved? What does FLP mean in practice?

Paxos : This lecture will present the “basic” Paxos protocol. Paxos is a powerful protocol for managing replicated data and widely used in cloud computing systems. The Chubby lock service mentioned in lecture 7 runs on top of Paxos.

Atomic multicast with Virtual Synchrony guarantees (Isis2), Atomic multicast, "Atomic multicast: How much ordering is needed?

Transactional model, ACID 

Implementing transactional services 

Bimodal Multicast. Astrolabe. Notion of “information diameter” of a system 

Building complex overlay networks using Gossip 

The RealTime Cloud 

Information Retrieval in the Facebook cloud 

Security concerns for consolidated systems. Synthetic diversity. 

Future cloud I: Computing on encrypted data

Future cloud II: Cloud virtualization 

The cloud value proposition.
