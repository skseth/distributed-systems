 my learnings on distributed systems

## business problem - happy path
* user selects a flight and a hotel
* confirm amount to user
* collect payment
* on payment confirmation book flight and hotel
* show booking details to customer

## Elaboration
* build as command line app
* make client server
* multiple clients
* multi-threaded server?
* scaling out 
* distributed flight / book / hotel bookings
* transactional integrity
* health monitoring
* availability
* caching
* partitioning
* disaster recovery
